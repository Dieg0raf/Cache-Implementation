# Logisim Evolution Cache Implementation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for a Cache implementation using Logisim Evolution â€“ a digital circuit simulation software. This project showcases the design and functionality of a basic cache system for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Cache Architecture**: A simple cache system designed to demonstrate fundamental cache concepts.
- **Logisim Evolution**: Utilizes Logisim Evolution for digital circuit simulation and visualization.

## Getting Started
To explore and simulate the cache implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    -  git clone https://github.com/Dieg0raf/Cache-implementation.git
2.  Download Logisim Evolution:
    -  Before running the simulation, ensure you have Logisim Evolution installed on your machine.
3.  Open the project file in Logisim Evolution:
    -  Launch Logisim Evolution.
    -  Open the project file cache_simulation.circ.
4.  Simulate the Cache:
    -  Use Logisim Evolution's simulation features to observe the cache behavior.
    -  Experiment with different inputs and explore how cache hits and misses are handled.
